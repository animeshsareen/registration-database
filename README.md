# University Registration DBA - UT Austin IT Desk

*Course: MIS 325 - Database Management*

*This was a long-form class project completed over the course of 9 weeks.*

First, we conducted an extensive amount of discovery 
research with school administrators to understand what the database requirements would be. 
Those can be found in the context file. 

Then, we created a DDL script in Oracle SQL to manage UT student registration. 

## Key Takeaways ##

**Database Design**

    - Basic RDBMS concepts + fundamentals
    - Primary key vs foreign key vs compound keys
    - 1-1 vs 1-M vs M-M relationships
    - Schema design techniques (simple, logical, phyical ERDs)

**Advanced SQL exposure**

   see ETL + DML + DCL + PL/SQL

**Optimizing query performance**

    - using index + sequences effectively

**Translating complex situations into syntax**
    - using JOIN + HAVING + GROUP BY + UNION
    - sub-queries
    - ROLLUP + CUBE, differences, shortcomings
    - Why Tableau-style tools are better sometimes
