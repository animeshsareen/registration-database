# University Registration DBA - UT Austin IT Desk

*Course: MIS 325 - Database Management*

*This was a long-form class project completed over the course of 9 weeks.*

First, we conducted an extensive amount of discovery 
research with school administrators to understand what the database requirements would be. 
Those can be found in the context file. 

Then, we created a DDL script in Oracle SQL to manage UT student registration.
