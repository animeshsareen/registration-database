# registration-database

*Course: MIS 325 - Database Management*
*This was a long-form class project completed over the course of 9 weeks.*


//

After conducting an extensive amount of discovery 
research with school administrators, we are asked to
create and maintain an Oracle RDBMS for UT student registration. 

This repo includes the situational context that's been defined by stakeholders,
as well as a seperate DDL script to reference for architecture. 

Finally, the schema.pdf is one possible approach to relational ERD design for this DBMS.
